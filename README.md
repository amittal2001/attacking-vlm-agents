# Malicious Image Patch (MIP) Generator

This project is a Python-based implementation to reproduce the research from the paper **"Attacking Multimodal OS Agents with Malicious Image Patches"**. It provides tools to generate adversarial image patches (MIPs) that can hijack Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into performing unintended actions.

## How To Use

Go to the Actions tabs, choose Run Agents workflow and it will run experimaents.json
for you in Azure.
